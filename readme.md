#jQuery Super Sticky Plugin#
*version 1.0, April 23, 2013*

*by Jason Rosenbaum, Corporate Action Network, https://github.com/j-ro/*

A smooth sticky plugin that keeps an element stuck onscreen no matter how far the user scrolls. Handles edge cases well (like elements that are longer than browser windows, or elements or wrappers that change height after load).


##Usage##

###Setup:###

Include the jquery.superSticky.js (or jquery.superSticky.min.js) in your HTML file after your jQuery include:

```html
<script src="jquery.superSticky.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
```

The plugin should work on sidebars in a wide range of DOM setups -- let me know if you have issues with your implementation in the issues section!


###Options:###
 		
**wrapper** -- a jQuery selector identifying the element that wraps around the sticky sidebar *(default: the sticky element's parent)*
 		
**padding_top** -- the amount of padding you want the sticky sidebar to maintain from the top of the browser window, in pixels. If this is larger than the element's initial top offset, top padding will be set to the elements initial top offset instead. *(default: 0)*
 		
**padding_bottom** -- the amount of padding you want the sticky sidebar to maintain from the bottom of the wrapper element, in pixels *(default: 0)*


###Methods:###

**init** -- called on load and when either the element or its wrapper change height


###Examples:###

```javascript		
$(document).ready(function() {
	//use defaults
	$('.sticky_element').superSticky();
});
```
 
```javascript		
$(document).ready(function() {
	//use custom options
	$('.sticky_element').superSticky({
		padding_top : 120,
		padding_bottom : 50,
		wrapper: '.action_page'
	});
});
```
